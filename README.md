# Guess My Number

The goal of this project is to guess a secret number which is between 1 and 20 in 20 trials. I learned how to implement the game logic with javascript.

## Project Description

If you guess the number and click check button, you can know whether your number is too high or too low. You can guess 20 times per game and replay the game with "Again!" button. Your highest score will be recorded during the games.

This project is a coding-along with the Udemy The Complete JavaScript Course 2022 by instructor Jonas Schmedtmann. HTML and CSS files were provided by the instructor.

### What I've learned:

- DOM Manipulation
- CSS Style Manipulation
- Event Handling
